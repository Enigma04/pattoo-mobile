About Pattoo
==================================

pattoo stores timeseries data in a database and makes it available for users via a GraphQL API.

It is flexible enough to chart a wide variety of data that changes over time by creating custom agents. There are guides to help you your own data collection agents to gather more generic time dependent information, like market prices, if you know where to obtain the data. Data can be collected from a number of sources.

The following is the documentation for Pattoo's mobile application
